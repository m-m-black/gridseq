# GridSeq

A 2-dimensional sequencer where rhythms propagate outwards from active cells.

### Instructions

*Make sure your sound is on.*

**GridSeq** runs in the browser on desktop and mobile devices. Click a cell to activate it, at which point it will turn white. Activate multiple cells to create rhythms. Sounds are triggered where active rows and columns intersect. Only 1 cell can be active in each row/column.

### TO DO

- [ ] Add browser detection for mobile devices
- [ ] Make text device specific (desktop/mobile)
- [ ] Add percussion synth instead of using samples
